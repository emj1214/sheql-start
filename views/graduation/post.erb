                        <p>A few weeks ago, I was in a camp specifically for teaching girls how to start a band, and they talked a lot about how while there are quite a few female musicins out there, they are not all well known. This website I decided, will help change that.</p>

                        <p>There was a lot of trial and error, and I think this took the longest time to put together.</p>

                        <p>I started with 3 pages before the one where this snippet comes up, and I hd to link them all together so that they could find and remember the user and what information the user put in. Then I had to get it to actually save things to my database, which is what this code is here. The last step was to get this to redirect to another page.</p>

                        <p>But! I wound up changing my tables part way through, so instead of a user only being able to be in a single band, a user could be in multiple bands. This was the point in which I realized that I would have to restructure most of this code. I this took about 5 days and lots of help to get put together.</p>
